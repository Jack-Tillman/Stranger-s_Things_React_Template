# Description

This repository holds the code for my Stranger's Things project completed during Fullstack Academy boot camp. The goal of the website is to create a site similar to Craig's List that enables users to make an account, create posts to sell whatever they would like, and send messages to other users through their posts. Users can also access their own profile page to see messages sent to them, messages they have sent, and posts that they have made. Additionally, the website features responsive design, so have fun changing the window size! 

## To check out for yourself:

1) After cloning down the repository, run 

### `npm run start`

This script installs all the necessary packages and dependencies, and then starts the local server. The site is accessible via the local url: localhost:3000
